IronHack Bootcamp second project - Quidditch Manager
From September 12th, 2021  – Until September 17th, 2021
Heden Sta. Apolónia


Description
The goal of Quidditch Manager was to further develop our knowledge of Express based 
full-stack applications with a focus on the back end of the application. To achieve this goal we 
used what we learned about NodeJS, MongoDB, HTTP protocols and authentication
to develop a fantasy sports simulator that was based on the sport of quidditch from the f
fictional series Harry Potter. The final version of this Express based full-stack app 
is in the following link:

IronHack Bootcamp final project - High Noon
From October 3rd, 2021  – Until October 8th, 2021
Heden Sta. Apolónia


Description
High Noon was the final project of the bootcamp and required us to put into practice all 
we learned in the course of the 9 week curriculum. To do so we developed a MERN stack
web application from scratch and we fully deployed it. High Noon is a productivity app
that was designed with ADHD individuals in mind. This shows in the welcoming UI choices
that don't overwhelm the user with information nor options. High Noon can be accessed
in the link below:
